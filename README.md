# Site-Check
Used to check whether a website is online - introduction to CURL (with PHP)

This project was originally chosen as my introduction to CURL (using PHP) when I was 15 years old.

---

This was originally inspired when my web browser kept showing the loading sign for various websites. I thought it would be a good challenge to try and design a website that checked whether a website's servers were running or not.

This was my first encounter with CURL in PHP. It took a lot of Google'ing to get through this project. And unfortunately not much of it stuck, as I have rarely needed to use CURL after that.

There are already other websites on the internet that do this, and from many different locations, but I thought it would be a good project to undertake. (And I can run it off locally).

This took 1-2 months to build (on-and-off).
